# Day-of-Week Sum with Missing-Day Averaging

This project contains a JavaScript solution to a coding challenge where:

- Given a dictionary where keys are dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and values are integers.
- The program converts dates into weekdays (`Mon`, `Tue`, ..., `Sun`).
- It sums the values for each weekday.
- If a weekday is missing, it fills it with the average of the previous and next day's values (rounded down).
